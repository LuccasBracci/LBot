	{ "quotes" : "Your bigotry is destroying the world! Your denial of me is only leading to further research on my part ans you lie, cheat, and steal from my website to get laid! You owe me, age gappers on Spokane! YOU OWE ME SOME KIND OF LOVE. Red Robin. Female company. That would be the BAREST amount of love you would owe me for even using this website to spell out your case while you women ignore me for some other guy. Is it the money or the meth connections or both? That's sad. $ocialism is *NOT* what Bernie Sanders was talking about."} ,

	{"quotes" : "Let's see. Things we were wrong about in the 20th century. Alcohol prohibition, marijuana prohibition, interracial marriage, The Holocaust, lowering taxes on the wealthy, Global Climate Change not being human caused, Reaganomics, NAFTA, same sex marriage prohibition, etc., that caused a loss of money and rising violence, so maybe it's time to raise sexual consent for males to 35 years old."} ,

	{"quotes" : "Prove your likeability to me. Let's go out to eat, girl. I'm looking for a woman under 26 to go out to eat with me. Write me something nice like an agreement for once in 5 years of my unquenched loneliness without you. Any hate at me gets your e-mail address blocked. Date me IRL otherwise you're not serious. You've taken everything from me. Every day without you makes me want to die and in many ways, it gives me my only reason to live."}
